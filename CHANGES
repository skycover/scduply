Major changes on top of duply.

* GLOBAL CONFIG

The file "conf" in ~/.duply or /etc/duply is sourced before profile's "conf"

This file is created automatically if not present.
By default the file contains no active settings - only the template.

* NAMED OPTIONS IN THE CONFIG FILE

The volume size and other duplicity options are now setted via separate shell
variables.

So it's now ok to source two global and profile's configs sequentally.

* SOURCE separated to the file

Backup source ($SOURCE) is now separated to the file "source", because now
it's ok the configurations with empty profile's "conf" file.

* SAVED ENVIRONMENT

The backup credentials (TARGET, GPG_* etc.) are now automatically saved to
"saved.env" file so it's still ok to save only profile folder even with global
config.

* PROFILE NAME PASSED TO DUPLICITY

Now the profile's name (if any) is passed to duplicity with --name and with
$TARGET's suffix.
So if the TARGET is file:///blah/blah, then the actual target folder will be
file:///blah/blah/NAME and the backup will be named NAME

* ARCHIVE_DIR FOR DUPLICITY

Support for --archive-dir

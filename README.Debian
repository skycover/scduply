duply for Debian
----------------

If you use duply with SSH than check that the needed ssh key is available.

For using of GnuPG check that all needed gpg keys are available and usable.
Sometimes GnuPG give you an error, because the key have no "trust". Please
set the trust of your gpg key in edit mode:

  gpg --edit-key <footprint>
  > trust
    => select "ultimate"
  > quit

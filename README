README for duply

duply (grown out of ftplicity), is a shell front end to duplicity that
simplifies the usage by managing settings for each backup job in profiles.
It supports executing multiple commands in a batch mode to enable single
line cron entries and executes pre/post backup scripts.
Since version 1.5.0 all duplicity backends are supported. Hence the name
changed from ftplicity to duply.

See http://duply.net or http://ftplicity.sourceforge.net/ for more info.
